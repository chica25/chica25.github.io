#### Hi there, Welcome to my portfolio website!

 I am a software engineer with a background in digital design and illustration. I'm currently doing a data science fellowship, that was pushed me to learn about data analysis and machine learning.

3 fun facts about me: I did a stop animation workshop in Prague, The Czech Republic, I am fluent in three languages and currently learning Japanese, and I am well familiar with most dog breeds. 

Below are some of my data science and fullstack engineering projects
![Automobile Project](https://github.com/chica25/Phase-1--automobile-project)
Worked on a Automobile dataset, created data visualizations and a linear regression model. 
Stacks: Python, Pandas, Jupytor and seaborn

![Shopping Data Analytics]([https://github.com/chica25/Phase-1--automobile-project](https://github.com/chica25/Shopping-Data-Analytics)https://github.com/chica25/Shopping-Data-Analytics)
This project gave an overview of shopping behavior and how consumers use promo-code and non-promo code when making purchases. 
Stacks: Python, Pandas, matplotlib.pyplot and sns
